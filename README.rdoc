==== Installation

You'll need to be running Ruby 2.2.3, if you don't have it already.

For rbenv users, first make sure your ruby-build is up to date with 
`cd ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build` and `git pull`. Then you should be able 
to run `rbenv install 2.2.3` without any problems.

RVM instructions to come.

With your version sorted, `git clone 
https://github.com/union-software-cooperative/labourhireinquiry.git`.
In the project directory, first set your `rbenv local 2.2.3`. Then 
you're clear to run `bundle install`. You may need to first install
Bundler with `gem install bundler` if yours was a fresh `ruby-2.2.3`
installation.

Things you may want to cover:

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...


Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
